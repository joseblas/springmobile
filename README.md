Spring Mobile
=============================
This code has been taken from zezutom at
http://zezutom.blogspot.com.es/2012/04/mobile-apps-on-spring.html
but I wanted to execute it from mvm (mvm tomcat:run). As he said, this app 
works fine with tomcat7, so I've added this feature.

Just download it, 

mvm tomcat7:run 
and go to 
http://localhost:8080/spring-mobile/

Have a nice day :)
